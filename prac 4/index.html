			<h1>Generally Grasping the General Git</h1>

			<h2>A workshop on the use of Git and version control.</h2>

			<p>Working on group projects can generally be a pain the arse. Some eijit ends up copying the wrong files over their USB stick, some twat ends up submitting an old build. Or some arsehole ends up losing everything while not paying attention to what they should be doing. Or perhaps the most heinous of group work crimes: you're sent code over Facebook contained in a Microsoft Word document.</p>

			<p>Obviously, this is not an ideal situation to be in, since in any group project, organization is key. That is why we, a group of students at the University of Strathclyde have teamed up with the  Computer and Information Sciences department to provide you with the "Generally Grasping the General Git" workshop, hosted in the Livingstone Tower on Friday the 14th of November from 1-5pm. This workshop will be a crash course on learning the basics of version control with Git as well as a chance to work on interesting projects in tandem with this Git workshop.</p>

			<p>By the end of this workshop you should be quite capable of organizing your group projects through Git ensuring more control over the group's progress through whatever project you are undertaking. Gone will the days of transferring files through USB stick, gone will be the days of transferring files through social media, and gone will be the days of poor organisation and consistency.</p>

			<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
