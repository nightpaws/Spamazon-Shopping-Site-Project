##
###Description##
Made by the people below for the class CS312 at the University of Strathclyde.

The aim of the assignment is to distract us from the main asignment of this class. This assignment is not even marked. We
are meant to create a small event page, that allows users to find out about the event sign up and chnage the theme of the site.
